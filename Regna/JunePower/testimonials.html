 <h4>James & Cynthia</h4>
 My wife and I were the kind of people who believed that using a realtor to buy or sell a home wasn’t worth it – That was the case until we met June Power.</p>
<p>In our more than one year home search working without a realtor, trying to navigate an insane market, we must have interacted with dozens of realtors. Many of the realtors we encountered seemed like perfectly good choices, many not so much, but after speaking with June, who came to our home and discussed everything with us in detail, it was almost immediately clear she out-shined them all.
<p>June’s honesty, hard work & dedication, attention to detail, intelligence, and professionalism in helping us to find a new home, and selling our current home was beyond valuable. Not to mention her friendliness, sense of humour, and availability(ice-storm or shine) made her wonderful to work with.</p>
<p>We couldn’t have been happier in being proved wrong as June truly demonstrated the value a realtor can provide to the highest degree.</p>
</div>
 <div class="testimonialDescription">
 <h4>Jessica O'Regan</h4>
 <p>June was professional, informative and above all, honest. We always knew she had our best interest at heart. She was approachable and helped us every step of the way. We highly recommend working with June.</p>
</div>
 <div class="testimonialDescription">
 <h4>Steve & Catherine</h4>
 <p>We have nothing but good things to say about June Power and we would recommend her to anyone that needs to sell or buy a house in London.</p>  
 <p>She is a wonderful, caring and compassionate person that actually cares about her clients. Her generous personality and sense of humour helped us get through one of the most stressful times in our life of relocating from London to Ottawa.</p>
 <p>June made selling our home a pleasure and it seemed so easy with her thoroughness to detail and thoughtfulness.  We made the right decision by going with June!</p>
</div>
 <div class="testimonialDescription">
 <h4>Kathy Courtney</h4>
<p>My name is Kathy Courtney. I know June Power through her selling my house this past
summer.</p>
<p>She is an outstanding Real estate person. She did an exceptional job
of selling our house. Her personality was perfect for my brother and I.</p>
<p>She worked extremely hard on our behalf.  She is kind, considerate, loyal and she is a really
hard worker – day and night.  Anyone who is buying a home or selling I would
recommend June for their salesperson. </p> 
<p>During the process of selling our home,
June made my brother and I feel very comfortable through this whole process –
she is so easy to get along with.  She is absolutely a fabulous person.  If there is
anything else that you require of me regarding June, I would be most happy to let
you know. </p> 
<p>Thank you.</p>

 <h4>John French</h4>
 <p>I have bought many houses in my life, and have not  came across any realtor like June Power. She goes above and beyond and actually cares about your wants and needs.</p>
<p>I was very picky with choosing my current house, and I met with her twice a week  for at least 6 weeks to explore more homes. She was more than courteous and very friendly.</p>
<p> She takes pride in her work, and it shows. She always put my needs first and even if I move out of the London area in the next few years, I will be using her as my realtor anywhere in Ontario.<p>
<p> She is very committed and very friendly, and I couldn’t of been happier with the experience, and I work in sales myself, so it does take a lot to impress me like she did!</p>
